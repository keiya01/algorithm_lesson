# Queue
# Performance
1. Queue
- unshift(enqueue):
- access head data(heap):
- access head data(dequeue):

2. Array
- unshift:
- access head data(array[0]):

# When is it used ?
- When a resource is shared among multiple consumers. Examples include CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling.
- When data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received at same rate as sent) between two processes. Examples include IO Buffers, pipes, file IO, etc.
